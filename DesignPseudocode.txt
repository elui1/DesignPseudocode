1. Find the average score

Algorithm:

1. Initialize sum.
2. Prompt user for exam score.
3. Add score to sum.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 ten times. 
5. Divide sum by 10.

Control structures: sequence, repetition
Variables: Sum, average, exam score
Check: Scores: 85, 90, 77, 82, 100, 87, 95, 68, 89, 92
	   Sum = 865
	   Average = Sum / 10 = 865 / 10 = 86.5
	   
	   Scores: 75, 85, 90, 70, 80, 100, 78, 87, 95, 88
	   Sum = 848
	   Average = 84.8


	   
2. How much water runs off the roof

Control structures: sequence
Variables: Roof height, roof width, inches of rainfall 
Constants: Number of gallons

Pseudocode:

Multiply roof height by 12, multiply roof width by 12. 
Multiply the resulting height and width together. 
Multiply this result by the number of inches of rainfall.
Divide the result by 231 to get the number of gallons.

Check: Start with a 60' x 30' roof. Multiplying by 12 gives 720" x 360".
	   720" x 360" x 2" = 518,400 cubic inches of water
	   518,400 / 231 = 2244.16 gallons
	   
	   Start with a 40' x 10' roof. Multiplying by 12 gives 480" x 120".
	   480" x 120" x 3" = 172,800 cubic inches of water
	   172,800 / 231 = 748.05 gallons
